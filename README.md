# Text Summarizer

This is a **Text Summarizer** web application. It takes any given text and summarizes it for you in a more concise form. The app uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the context and key points of the text and present a summary.

You can access the live app at [**Text Summarizer Demo**](https://summarizer2.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- **Input any text**: Paste any content (article, essay, etc.) into the app.
- **Automatic Summarization**: The app uses state-of-the-art NLP models to generate a summary of the input text.
- **Adjustable Summary Length**: You can choose to get a shorter or longer summary based on your needs.

## Deployment

The live Streamlit app is deployed and can be accessed here:  
[**Text Summarizer Demo**](https://summarizer2.streamlit.app/)

## Installation
